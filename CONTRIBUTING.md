## Contributing

I like when people send pull requests. It validates my existence. If you want to help out, check the [issue list](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/issues?sort=updated&state=open) or search the codebase for `TODO`. Don't worry if you lack experience writing C. If I think a pull request isn't ready to be merged, I'll give feedback in comments. Once everything looks good, I'll comment on your pull request with a cool animated gif and hit the merge button.
